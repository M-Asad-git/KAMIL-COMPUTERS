# Website Setup Guide - Dynamic Products from Database

## Overview
Your website now fetches products dynamically from the backend API instead of using static hardcoded data. This means:
- **Admin Panel**: Add/edit/delete products â†’ saves to MySQL database
- **Website**: Displays products from the same database in real-time
- **Real-time Updates**: Products added in admin appear immediately on website

## Prerequisites
- Backend API server running on port 4000
- MySQL database with products table
- Admin panel working and able to add products

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the `env.template` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp env.template .env
```

2. The `.env` file should contain:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Step 3: Start the Website
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Important**: The website runs on port 3001 to avoid conflicts with the admin panel (port 3000).

## Step 4: Verify Dynamic Products
1. **Add a product from admin panel** (`http://localhost:3000`)
2. **Check website** (`http://localhost:3001/products`) - the product should appear
3. **Real-time updates** - no need to restart anything

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
Admin Panel (Port 3000)
    â†“ (Adds product to database)
MySQL Database
    â†“ (API fetches data)
Backend API (Port 4000)
    â†“ (Website requests data)
Website (Port 3001)
    â†“ (Displays products)
User sees dynamic products
```

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Product Display**: Products added in admin appear on website instantly
- **Dynamic Categories**: Filter by Laptops, Desktops, Accessories
- **Search Functionality**: Search products by name or description
- **Stock Information**: Shows available stock for each product
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Website shows "No products available yet"
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure backend API is running (`http://localhost:4000`)
2. Check if products exist in database
3. Verify API endpoint `/api/products` returns data

### Issue: Products not updating on website
**Solution**:
1. Refresh the website page
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify backend is connected to MySQL

### Issue: Images not displaying
**Solution**:
1. Ensure image URLs in admin are valid
2. Check if images are accessible from website
3. Fallback placeholder images will show if needed

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start All Services:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API
cd apps/apis
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Admin Panel
cd apps/admin
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Website
cd apps/website
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Flow:
1. **Add product** in admin panel
2. **Check website** - product should appear
3. **Edit product** in admin - changes reflect on website
4. **Delete product** in admin - removed from website

### 3. Monitor Logs:
- Backend: Check for database connection and API requests
- Admin: Check for successful product creation
- Website: Check for successful API calls

## API Endpoints Used by Website

- `GET /api/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get specific product
- `GET /api/products?category=Laptops` - Filter by category
- `GET /api/products?name=search` - Search products

## Benefits of This Setup

âœ… **Real-time Updates**: No manual content updates needed
âœ… **Centralized Management**: All products managed from admin panel
âœ… **Consistent Data**: Same product info across admin and website
âœ… **Scalable**: Easy to add more products and features
âœ… **Professional**: Dynamic content like modern e-commerce sites

## Next Steps

Once this is working, you can enhance:
- **Product Reviews**: Add customer reviews system
- **Inventory Management**: Track stock levels automatically
- **Order System**: Allow customers to place orders
- **Analytics**: Track product views and performance
- **SEO**: Dynamic meta tags for each product

Your website is now a dynamic, professional e-commerce platform! ðŸš€
